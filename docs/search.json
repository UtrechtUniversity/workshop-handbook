    "text": "Jaarplanning\nBefore commencing the with the jaarplanning, the department should decide on which workshops will be offered (or not) and who will be involved in the workshop as leads and instructors/helpers. This would likely be decided during the Annual Review.\n\nWorkshop Agenda\nBy the end of May, we should have the jaarplanning for the next academic year ready.\nWhen doing this jaarplanning, we should take the following into account:\n\nthe frequency of the workshop,\nthe preferred days for the workshop,\nthe number of participants for the workshop,\n\nMoreover, the workshops should be spaced out well, so we donâ€™t have weeks that are too busy or vice versa.\nHere is an example of the workshop agenda for 2023-2024: RDM Support -&gt; General -&gt; Training & Workshops -&gt; Workshop Communication Materials -&gt; workshops-planning-2023-2024.xlsx\n\n\n\nRoom Booking\nWe need to book locations for all the workshops in advance. This can be done via the the booking system or by contacting colleagues in Publieksdiensten (probably not called the same now after the reorganization).\n\n\n\nOutlook Calendar\nWhen the jaarplanning is done, put it in an Outlook calendar that can be shared with everyone.\n\nYou can use the Excel sheet from the jaarplanning to create calendar items in bulk. Here are two links for reference:\n\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-import-excel-records-into-an-outlook-calendar/\nhttps://www.auditexcel.co.za/blog/import-excel-appointments-into-outlook-calendar/\n\nAfter that, you can choose to either share or publish your Outlook calendar:\n\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-your-calendar-in-outlook-com-0fc1cb48-569d-4d1e-ac20-5a9b3f5e6ff2\n\n\n\nSign Up Sheet\nAlso make a page where people can sign up or simply report who will be going.\nMay be redundant with the pool of instructors and helpers but might still help maintain overview. Maybe sign up for the whole academic year / commit to one workshop and then figure it out within your team. To be discussed.\nHere is a link to the sign-up sheet for 2023-2024: RDM Support -&gt; Team Code and Software -&gt; Workshops & Cafes (tab)\nThe Excel sheet can also be used as a basis for creating this sign-up sheet tab, you donâ€™t have to create entries separately."

End the workshop with necessary closing information.\nAfter the workshop, it may be helpful to have an informal discussion on how the workshop went.
