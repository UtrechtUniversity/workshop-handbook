# New {.unnumbered}

-	We need a TIMELINE for the jaarplanning and coordination â€“ when do we wanna schedule big group meetings, review moments, determine leads ðŸŽ‰
-	Create a TASK BOARD for workshops if we think itâ€™s useful.
-	List the workshops + e-learnings we want do/maintain next academic year. Determine what to do with stuff that might be phased out (if at all). You might archive it for example.
-	Determine the leads of these workshops, as well as a pool of instructors and helpers per workshop. Clarify and agree on what these roles mean and involve (and not).
-	Do a jaarplanning where all the workshops are spread out evenly, at a frequency that suits everyone and on preferred days.
-	Book locations for the workshops.
-	Create an Outlook calendar for the workshops and share it with everyone.
-	Create a sign up sheet where people can add themselves as instructors and helpers. May be redundant with the pool of instructors and helpers but might still help maintain overview. Maybe sign up for the whole academic year / commit to one workshop and then figure it out within your team. To be discussed.
