This would likely be decided during the Annual Review.\n\n### Workshop Agenda\n\nBy the end of May, we should have the jaarplanning for the next academic year ready. \n\nWhen doing this jaarplanning, we should take the following into account:\n\n- the _frequency_ of the workshop,\n- the _preferred days_ for the workshop,\n- the _number of participants_ for the workshop,\n\nMoreover, the workshops should be _spaced out_ well, so we don't have weeks that are too busy or vice versa.\n\nHere is an example of the workshop agenda for 2023-2024: [RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials -> workshops-planning-2023-2024.xlsx](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials/workshops-planning-2023-2024.xlsx?d=w0037faec227d49c09d11be856d3c3cbb&csf=1&web=1&e=06E4BJ&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0)\n\n![](images/workshop-agenda.PNG)\n\n### Room Booking\n\nWe need to book locations for all the workshops in advance. This can be done via the the booking system or by contacting colleagues in _Publieksdiensten_ (probably not called the same now after the reorganization).\n\n![](images/workshop-agenda.PNG)\n\n### Outlook Calendar\n\nWhen the jaarplanning is done, put it in an Outlook calendar that can be shared with everyone.\n\n![](images/outlook-calendar.PNG)\n\nYou can use the Excel sheet from the jaarplanning to create calendar items in bulk. Here are two links for reference:\n\n1. [example 1](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-import-excel-records-into-an-outlook-calendar/) \n\n2. [example 2](https://www.auditexcel.co.za/blog/import-excel-appointments-into-outlook-calendar/)\n\nAfter that, you can choose to either share or publish your Outlook calendar:\n\n- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-your-calendar-in-outlook-com-0fc1cb48-569d-4d1e-ac20-5a9b3f5e6ff2\n\n### Sign Up Sheet\n\nAlso make a page where people can sign up or simply report who will be going.\n\nMay be redundant with the pool of instructors and helpers but might still help maintain overview. Maybe sign up for the whole academic year / commit to one workshop and then figure it out within your team. To be discussed.\n\nHere is a link to the sign-up sheet for 2023-2024: [RDM Support -> Team Code and Software -> Workshops & Cafes (tab)](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/26bc2873-6023-480c-a11b-76b66605ce8c/_djb2_msteams_prefix_1765026388?context=%7B%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3Aa5f3eb9fa731402c91171d0ef1eed535%40thread.skype%22%7D&tenantId=d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7)\n\nThe Excel sheet can also be used as a basis for creating this sign-up sheet tab, you don't have to create entries separately.\n\n![](images/sign-up-sheet.PNG)\n\n## Website\n\nThe following folder contains (per workshop) all the texts for landing pages, agenda items, Formdesk forms and confirmations, pre- and post-workshop emails: [RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials?csf=1&web=1&e=dab1La)\n\nThere is also an Excel sheet to track the review and update of materials: [](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials/workshops-planning-2023-2024.xlsx?d=w0037faec227d49c09d11be856d3c3cbb&csf=1&web=1&e=ggINu4&nav=MTVfezYzREREOTdELTNBNkMtNDJDOS1BRTQ2LTFDNzQ2MzBFMzZBRX0)\n\n![RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials -> workshops-planning-2023-2024.xlsx](images/workshop-materials-checklist.PNG)\n\n### Landing Page\n\nReview the landing page text for all workshops. Lilli makes template and the workshop leads do the reviewing (primarily of workshop description/content, the more admin stuff will be generic).\n\nExample of landing page for Introduction to R & Data: [https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/training-workshops/introduction-to-r-data](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/training-workshops/introduction-to-r-data)\n\nThe landing page is a generic description of the workshop and includes an overview of all workshop dates with link to the specific agenda item.\n\n- prerequisties\n- what you can expect (or not)\n- UU and UU-affiliated only\n- costs\n- deregistration and no-show/dropout policy\n\nNote that a Dutch translation will be needed as well.\n\n### Agenda Items\n\nThe agenda item is specific to a workshop date/occurence and includes the link to the registration form.\n\nExample of agenda item for Introduction to R & Data: [https://www.uu.nl/en/events/introduction-to-r-data-may-2024](https://www.uu.nl/en/events/introduction-to-r-data-may-2024)\n\nNote that a Dutch translation will be needed as well.\n\n## Formdesk\n\nHow to handle waitlists? \nMaximum number of participants? Maximum number of waitlisted participants?\n\n### Formdesk Form\n\nThe Formdesk registration form is largely the same for all workshops. There are generic questions related to registration, but a couple of specific questions per workshop.\n\nMake sure that the werkstudenten ensure only UU and UU-affiliated addresses are accepted for registration! Provide a list of these addresses (UMCU, PMC, etc.)\n\nHere is a link to the default questions for Formdesk at the moment: [RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials -> _formdesk -> default-questions-formdesk-registration.docx](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials/_formdesk/default-questions-formdesk-registration.docx?d=wdc1e2777ebe8453bb61f453f106e50fc&csf=1&web=1&e=Vxd94A)\n\n### Browser Confirmation\n\nThis refers to the text that appears in your browser when the registration is confirmed. It points to [info.rdm@uu.nl](info.rdm@uu.nl) as contact point in case a confirmation email is not received.\n\n[RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials -> _formdesk -> default-questions-formdesk-confirmation.docx](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials/_formdesk/default-formdesk-confirmation.docx?d=wee2a03a810e74d40aeea4e8cb1e5be6b&csf=1&web=1&e=PBbgGp)\n\n### Confirmation Email\n\nThis refers to the email that participants receive when their registration is confirmed. It points to [info.rdm@uu.nl](info.rdm@uu.nl) as contact point and includes a personalized link for deregistration.\n\n[RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials -> _formdesk -> default-questions-formdesk-confirmation.docx](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials/_formdesk/default-formdesk-confirmation.docx?d=wee2a03a810e74d40aeea4e8cb1e5be6b&csf=1&web=1&e=PBbgGp)\n\nWe might want to consider putting the pre-workshop email in the Formdesk confirmation email already?\n\n## Werkstudenten\n\nOnce all the documents have been reviewed and/or updated, have the Communicatie werkstudenten put everything online. They can be contacted at: werkstudentCC@uu.nl\n\nIt can take them up to a month to process everything for a whole academic year. We naturally want to prioritize the workshops from September-December, so people can already start signing up for that.\n\nSome things they should do: number of participants, UU & UU-affiliated addresses, specify the owners and co-owners for the form, notification if it's registration less than 7 days.\n\nIt would be helpful to give them a briefing of instructions like in this document: [RDM Support -> General -> Training & Workshops -> Workshop Communication Materials -> briefing-work-students.docx](https://solisservices.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/RDMSpeeltuin/Shared%20Documents/General/Trainings%20and%20Workshops/Workshop%20Communication%20Materials/briefing-work-students%20.docx?d=wd1d0b1b5d61e432699f668dfe89ae60f&csf=1&web=1&e=iVl4Iz)\n\n### New\n\n-\tWe need a TIMELINE for the jaarplanning and coordination â€“ when do we wanna schedule big group meetings, review moments, determine leads ðŸŽ‰\n-\tCreate a TASK BOARD for workshops if we think itâ€™s useful.\n-\tList the workshops + e-learnings we want do/maintain next academic year. Determine what to do with stuff that might be phased out (if at all). You might archive it for example.\n-\tDetermine the leads of these workshops, as well as a pool of instructors and helpers per workshop. Clarify and agree on what these roles mean and involve (and not).\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"before.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
